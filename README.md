Fundamentals of programming group project

Part I: Problem Analysis, Program Design and Implementation
Instruction: Analyze the problem given below, and (b) draw flow chart and write a pseudocode to describe the algorithm that you apply to solve the following problem and then 
transform the algorithms into program.

question number 4: Write a program that convert decimal number to binary, octal and hexadecimal and vice versa. 
The program should accept an integer number and create number system conversion table. And 
also the program let the user to input the number in any format (i.e. in decimal or binary or 
octal or hexadecimal) and convert to equivalent all other number system.

PART II: Pattern Printing
Write a program that accepts a positive integer, n, or a letter entered by the user and prints the 
following shape. But if the value entered is less than one, the program prints nothing.

question a and f.
